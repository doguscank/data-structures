# Data Structures

This repo contains code blocks that I wrote to train myself.

## To-Do

* Re-write C++ codes with correct class definitions (like adding setters and getters)
* Add comments
* Find a solution for template classes in C++ in order to lower output size (all the definitions of template classes are in header files right now)
